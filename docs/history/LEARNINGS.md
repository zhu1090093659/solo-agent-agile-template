## Adding New Entries

When adding a new learning:

1. Include the date for context
2. Be specific about what happened
3. Explain what was learned
4. Document any actions taken
5. Link to related resources

Good learnings help future development by:
- Preventing repeated mistakes
- Sharing knowledge
- Building institutional memory
