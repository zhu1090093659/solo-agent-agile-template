description: Load current work context for this session
---

Please load the current development context by reading these files in order:

1. First, read @STATUS.md to understand:
   - What task is currently in progress
   - What was completed in the last session
   - Any blockers or open questions
   - What the next steps are

2. Based on STATUS.md, identify the current Epic and read:
   - The Epic's EPIC.md for overall goals
   - The Epic's tasks.md for specific task status
   - The Epic's notes.md for any recent learnings

3. If the current task involves a specific module, read:
   - src/modules/[module]/MODULE.md for module overview
   - src/modules/[module]/INTERFACE.md if working on interfaces

4. Check @.claude/MEMORY.md for any persistent notes from previous sessions

After reading, provide a brief summary:

## Current Context

**Epic**: [Name and current status]
**Task**: [Current task being worked on]
**Last Session**: [Brief summary of what was done]
**Blockers**: [Any blockers, or "None"]
